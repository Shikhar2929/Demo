# Exchange Client Program
Fill out your trading strategy in `TradingClient.algorithm`.

## Setting Up Environment
We support 2 environments tools: `pyenv` and `venv`.
If you don't already have `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` installed, use `venv`. We recommend `python 3.10.14`, but it may work with other versions (we just haven't tested them).

### Using pyenv
`source scripts/env.sh pyenv`
### Using venv
`source scripts/env.sh venv`

For Windows Users, first run .venv\Scripts\activate

On VSCode, select the Kernel and then "Create Python Environments." Then select the "Delete and Recreate" the environment.
